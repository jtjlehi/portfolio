                        <p class='noIndent'>My name is Jared Jacobson. I was born in Orem, Utah on May 4, 2000.</p>
                        <p>I have always been a very imaginative person. At the age of three, I thought I was Peter Pan. In first grade, I thought the school kept the center of the sun in a shed. My friends and I believed the sun would give us superpowers.
                        My imagination quickly grew into curiosity. I began to be fascinated with the stars and weather patterns and math. I would read books, both fiction and non-fiction. I would come up with new ideas and solutions to problems and concepts for inventions.</p>
                        <p>Curiosity, ingenuity, imagination, and a love of learning are all characteristics of a scholar and are what make me a sterling scholar.</p>

                        <h3 class='mdl-card__title-text'>The Website Design Process</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class='mdl-card__supporting-text'>
                        <p>When a creator wants to showcase his skill, he uses a portfolio. He puts his success and failures in it. He explains the process he went through. Traditionally a portfolio would be in physical form. In recent years there has been a big shift towards online portfolios especially for those who work with computers. I made my portfolio website as a way to showcase my skill to employers and as a sterling scholar.</p>
                        <p>I began first with research and discovered a few things: most sites are designed like blogs, a good site will stand out, for anything to stand out it must be different, a portfolio will show your failures, and a portfolio shows how you learn from projects. Using what I learned I created an outline for my website. The landing page would have a logo in the center with navigation to four pages, one from each side. When clicked the navigation would then pull the page being navigated to onto the screen.</p>
                        <p>I started by designing the style of the landing page. The style was pretty easy until I began trying to spin the two side navigation buttons. I probably spent 2 days before the page looked right. The next part was harder. Using a factory function I created four functions, one for each direction, that animated the navigation to the new page. I came across many errors and problems and had to do a lot more research into CSS transitions before I finally got it to work.</p>
                        <p>There was a new feature added with HTML5 that only works because of ES2016 called 'HTML components.' I thought the best way for me to do my website would be to use them. The problem was that I didn't know how to use them. Instead of not using them and saving time, I tried to learn. In the end, I was unable to learn them quickly enough and I wasted 3 or 4 weeks before I realized that for a small project HTML5 components are not the best choice. Luckily I use Git on for all my projects, and I was able to go back to before I added components, but I still lost about 4 weeks of time.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the project was relatively easy, but I learned a very valuable lesson. When doing small projects with a deadline it is better to use what I know instead of trying to learn an all-new feature.</p>

            <!-- Physics Club -->
            <div class='carousel-item'>
                <article class='mdl-card mdl-shadow--16dp'>

                        <h3 class='mdl-card__title-text'>Creating and Founding the Physics Club</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class='mdl-card__supporting-text'>
                        <p>In sixth grade, I took a math placement test. I did so well that I was invited to skip seventh-grade math. From that time forward I was in love with math. Because of my love of math, I was advised to take AP Physics instead of regular physics.</p>
                        <p>Near the end of the year, I decided I loved physics so much I would start a physics club. In order to start a club, I had to petition for it. I had to collect 50 high school student signatures. For many clubs, 50 signatures would have been easy, but even among some of my closest friends, people would not sign the petition. I set up a booth at back to school night to promote the future club, and get signatures. In the first hour, I received about 10 signatures. Feeling discouraged I was thinking about going home, but I had friends who said they were going to come and see me and sign the petition. Quickly, more people began going to my booth and I had over 50 signatures long before the night ended.</p>
                        <p>I sent the request and petition in and waited for a response from the school board. The advisor and I decided we could still hold activities, we just wouldn't have any funding. Our first activity was quite a success, we had about 10 people show up and everyone had fun.</p>
                        <p>My ambition told me that 10 people were not enough so I planned an activity I thought would appeal to a wider range of people: an egg drop. Enlisting the help of the student council artist, I made four different posters and hung them up in the commons, I told everyone about the activity, and I knew it would be a success. I bought fifty eggs the night before, but only 3 other people showed up. All of my marketing and campaigning had been for nothing.</p>
                        <p>After a few days, I realized that while not a lot of people showed up, I still had fun. I began to care more about planning fun activities and less about getting people to come.</p>
                        <p>We planned activities that were usually competitive in nature, except when we got an entire vat of liquid nitrogen. The club has continued to grow and has become a success.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class='mdl-card__supporting-text'>
                        <p>There I was, caring a giant roll of shrink wrap out of Walmart. The manager had given it to me because I was working on my eagle project. I needed the roll to wrap about 12 computers so they could be shipped to Ghana through the Forever Young Foundation. I had my scout troop come over, and in just under an hour, we wrapped them and then proceeded to wrap each other.</p>
                        <p>The computers were then picked up by one of the foundation employees and sent to Ghana. Each computer sent could help at least one whole family get out of poverty because it would give them access to more information and provide them with an opportunity to learn new skills. The skills would provide them with job opportunities where they could work less and get paid more. The computer would also give the family a chance to connect with more people and would improve the quality of life in unimaginable ways. When I learned this I was astounded to learn that something as simple as a computer could have such a big impact on a family.</p>
                        <p>I did not just have 12 computers at my house when I picked my eagle project, so the actual first step was collecting computers. I planned a collection event for one Saturday. I put out fliers telling people to bring their computers to my local church. The computers had to be wiped and we had to make sure they had the correct hardware and software. Many of the computers we collected were old, and we had to send them to the dump.</p>
                        <p>After the computers were wiped and wrapped I had to get bins to send them in. When I found bins strong enough to hold the computers I was finally able to send the computers off. It was wonderful to see all the hard work my troop and I had put in finally come to fruition, and I was excited that twelve families would finally get a computer. I do not know who the computers went to but I feel a connection to them nonetheless.</p>

                        <p>It happened again: a bug. I can’t find where it is. The console says it is on line 35, but there is nothing there. 30 minutes pass before I find the solution. Now I just need to test it. Except it doesn’t work. An hour of troubleshooting and I have gotten nowhere. Finally, I found it. The real problem lies in an entirely different module. I now have to rewrite that entire module. 4 hours later I realize I missed dinner and haven’t done any homework, but the bug is fixed and I am happy.</p>
                        <p>I have always liked computers. My mom is a graphic designer and for years I would watch her make logos and design book covers. In 8th grade, I decided to learn more about computers by taking a communications class. In this class, we learned about computer programming, and I was hooked. Since that time I have been trying to learn all I can.</p>
                        <p>The first thing I did was look on the internet for places I could learn more programming. I found and took free courses that taught languages like Python and Ruby. I soon realized though that what I was learning was just the beginning, so I looked for ways to learn more. I began to do little projects. I made a kinematic calculator in ruby, and as I learned more advanced languages, I made a tic-tac-toe game.</p>
                        <p>What I learned while doing these coding projects was that coding was problem-solving, and I loved it. I wasn’t regurgitating information anymore, I was actually having to reason about a solution. I began turning to friends for help, and I became very good at googling, but I was still struggling to learn more.</p>
                        <p>On top of the problem solving I also can make things. With an HTML page, I can, in just a few hours, display lots of information. I can create a tic-tac-toe game in under a day using Javascript. I can make a banking app with Typescript. This ability, creating something from nothing to solve problems is why I code.</p>
                        <p>I have found that the more I code, the more I enjoy it. There are times when I will sit and code for hours, and it is all because I love to problem solve.</p>

                        <p>In order to graduate from my web development course at MTECH, I have to complete an externship. When I finish my externship I will go on an LDS mission. When I get back from my mission I plan to go to college to study Computer Science. I will work through college as a Web Developer to pay for college, save money, and gain experience. </p>
                        <p>After college, I hope to do work in Deep Neural Networks. I would like to approach it in more of an object-oriented way. Most Neural Networks currently are concerned mainly with computation, and take a more functional approach, which limits their ability to deal with data. By giving the networks direct access to data, both to manipulate it, and use it in their computations.</p>
                        <p>I will be doing something I love, and I will be making a decent income to provide for my family. In computer technology, I have found something I love to do and that will provide me with a decent income. This is why I love to code.</p>

                        <p>The banking app was an application designed to keep track of transactions and interest for 3 different types of bank accounts. It did not take care of the verification or how the transfers take place. I did it to see a real-world application of Object Oriented Programming. I implemented the "Inheritance Pattern" by setting up a base bank account and extending it to the 3 base accounts so I didn't have to repeat much. The pattern did work for this kind of application, but the decorator pattern may have worked better for a larger scale version of the app because each account would only extend 1 level down from the base bank account class.</p>
                        <p>I wrote this banking app using TypeScript and designed no user interface for it, to view and run the code follow the GitHub link below and run the compiled JavaScript in a Node.js environment.</p>

                        <p>I decided to make a golf scorecard for the challenge of the interface, and logic. I implemented jQuery into this program to make it a little easier but found the library difficult to use. I had intended on doing the whole project without a CSS library, but about halfway through the project, I decided it was a ridiculous endeavor and implemented Material Design Light, which is why the style is not uniform throughout the whole page. I intended on adding some cool features that other golf-scorecards lacked, but when I finally got the card working properly I decided not to. I learned through this experience that it is ok to use CSS libraries, and further cemented my dislike for jQuery.</p>

                            <p>All over the internet people say one of the best ways to learn JavaScript is by making a "Todo-List-App." I made this one by implementing MDL, and without using any jQuery. Because of my insistence not to use jQuery, I came face to face with the very mean document object model (DOM), and had far more problems then it was worth. While I got most of the features to work some of the time, I was so sick of the project that I eventually just stopped doing it. </p>
                            <p>I learned quite a few lessons from this project, and don't consider it a failure. I learned that it is ok to use other's code, I learned the importance of breaking down what I am doing into manageable chunks, and I learned that the DOM was the real enemy, not jQuery.</p>
